Exhibit/Exhibit.java
 The main class. Execute this class to begin running the software. (Note, you won't get very far unless you can connect to the rover. Exhibit loads the main part of the interface in the background while it waits for the user to enter the IP address of the rover. It will not allow you to continue until you have successfully connected to the rover.)
