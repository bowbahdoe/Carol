Provides classes and interfaces for high-level rover control and for logging. The majority of classes in this package implement the Action interface. Each Action represents a high-level rover capability such as driving to a point or locating a target rock nearby. Rover programmers can access all of the PER's capabilities through the Rover class and the Action classes.
